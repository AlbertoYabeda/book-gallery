# book_gallery

A new Flutter project to fetch data from google books api.
I built this project, is a challenge that was given to me by <em>App And Up</em> to build it in few days.

## The app have the following features
- user authentication with email (and password) and authenticate with google.
- user can search for books
- user can save a book to favourite collection (list saved to firestore)
- user can remove a book from favourite collection
- user can see the details of each book.

#### the app still need some improviments
